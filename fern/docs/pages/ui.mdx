## Gradio UI user manual

Gradio UI is a ready to use way of testing most of PrivateGPT API functionalities.

### Execution Modes

It has 3 modes of execution (you can select in the top-left):

* Query Docs: uses the context from the
  ingested documents to answer the questions posted in the chat. It also takes
  into account previous chat messages as context.
    * Makes use of `/chat/completions` API with `use_context=true` and no
      `context_filter`.
* Search in Docs: fast search that returns the 4 most related text
  chunks, together with their source document and page.
    * Makes use of `/chunks` API with no `context_filter`, `limit=4` and
      `prev_next_chunks=0`.
* LLM Chat: simple, non-contextual chat with the LLM. The ingested documents won't
  be taken into account, only the previous messages.
    * Makes use of `/chat/completions` API with `use_context=false`.

### Document Ingestion

Ingest documents by using the `Upload a File` button. You can check the progress of
the ingestion in the console logs of the server.

The list of ingested files is shown below the button.

If you want to delete the ingested documents, refer to *Reset Local documents
database* section in the documentation.

### Chat

Normal chat interface, self-explanatory ;)

You can check the actual prompt being passed to the LLM by looking at the logs of
the server. We'll add better observability in future releases.
